title: XSS in mail.aol.com
---
I got bored one day and somehow thought of AOL for some reason, so I decided to see if I could find any vulnerabilities in mail.aol.com. Initially I tried looking in the signature, since it allowed HTML. I did find an XSS there, but it was self-xss, because when you sent an email with the malicious signature, the javascript was filtered out.<br><br>
I looked at all the other parameters shown in an email to see if I could bypass filtering but came up empty.
Then another potential place for an XSS came to me: the **reply-to** parameter! I opened up Apple Mail on my Mac Book, created a new email and eventually came up with this payload: 
<br>
`<<h1/onmouseover=javascript:confirm&#040document.cookie&#041 width=800 height=800 style=@aol.com>`<br><br>
I added that as the reply-to email and sent it to the AOL I had created. When I tried to reply to the email, my payload triggered! 
<br><br>
